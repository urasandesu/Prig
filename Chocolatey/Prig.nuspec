    <summary>
      Prig is a lightweight framework for test indirections in .NET Framework.
    </summary>
    <description>
      Prig(PRototyping jIG) is a framework that generates a Test Double like Microsoft Fakes/Typemock Isolator/Telerik JustMock based on Unmanaged Profiler APIs. This framework enables that any methods are replaced with mocks. For example, a static property, a private method, a non-virtual member and so on.

    <releaseNotes>Version 2.2.0
* Fixed #57: Support for Continuous Integration Server (like AppVeyor). Add some special APIs and maintenance document to explain them. For details, please see [our Wiki](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/AppVeyor-Support).
* Fixed #58: Needs more robustness for additional delegates. Ignore the additional delegate that doesn't exist, because build error occurs even if the delegate doesn't relevant.
* Fixed potential bugs. Some multiple threads race conditions existed. These were found by Coverity.


Version 2.1.1
* Update middleware. Boost is updated from 1.55.0 to 1.60.0.
* Fixed infrastructure's bug. The function to parse PE header was wrong. This bug affected the environment installed Visual Studio 2015 or more. See also [the comment of the issue](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/issues/56#issuecomment-169983706).
* Reduce environmental dependence. Until this improvement, `Add-PrigAssembly` command used absolute path instead of relative path or environment variable. So, any build will fail on another environment different from first setup without `*.csproj` modification.
* Improve prig.exe help. Also, we maintain [out wiki](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/Command-Line-Reference) to explain it.


Version 2.1.0
* Fixed #48: No longer need install.ps1 for NuGet. Clean up the content.
* Fixed #49: Minimize the dependency to Chocolatey. Prig can support standalone installation via VSIX since this version.
* Fixed #52: Support Visual Studio 2015 Update 1. Deal that the test execution engine is changed from `vstest.executionengine` to `TE.ProcessHost.Managed`.
* Fixed some potentially bugs for `prig` command. It could not remove the symbolic link that has been already moved. Additionaly, improve some error messages.


Version 2.0.0
* Fixed #31: Issue with out parameters.
* Fixed #46: Support mocking DLL imports.
* Against the comment-based help of Prig management commands, unified the definition of word because they were defined. See also our [wiki](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/Cheat-Sheet).


Version 2.0.0-alpha06
* Fixed #45: Support Visual Studio 2015
* Fixed #44: Namespace reference not added for parameter that is array type
  [NOTICE] This issue has already been fixed in the family of V2. We just applied the fix to the family of V1.
* Improve installation robustness. The `ExecutionPolicy` of PowerShell that is invoked during build tasks was sometimes unexpected, so modify to set explicit value.
* Enhance supported signature. The unusual types that appear on the interface of a method is almost supported. For example, `T[,][]`(`T` is a generic type parameter), `List&lt;DateTime[]&gt;[,]`, `out M[][,]`(`M` is a generic method parameter) and so on.
* Prepare to support three or more out/ref parameters. By decreasing the dependencies of an indirection stub that profiler used, performance is also improved.


Version 1.1.1
* [NOTICE] The family of v1 will be obsolete soon. We strongly recommend migrating to the family of the v2. About the way of the migration, please see [our Wiki](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/Migration-from-v1-to-v2).
* Support Visual Studio 2015.
* Merge the fixes that were applied to the family of the v2.


Version 2.0.0-alpha05
* Improve stability for the methods of the classes that are used on the boundary of application domains(e.g. `AppDomain`, `BinaryReader`, `MemoryStream`, `Thread` and so on).
* Improve usability for the command to manage Prig a little(See also [the Wiki](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/Command-Line-Reference#pfind)).
* Merge Infrastructure Bug Fix(See also Swathe issues [#2](https://github.com/urasandesu/Swathe/issues/2))
* Make the sequence that builds the indirection stub dll more efficient.


Version 2.0.0-alpha04
* Update NUnit Test Adapter for Prig from based on 1.2.0 to based on 2.0.0.
* [BREAKING CHANGE] To fix the following issues, alpha04 has lost compatibility with alpha03. Also, `choco upgrade` command cannot even work. I will publish the migration steps in [this page](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/Migration-from-alpha03-to-alpha04) as soon as possible.
* Fixed #41: Error in remove prig assembly
* Fixed #40: Test engine crashes while trying to execute a unit test without indirections context even when it doesn't use any stubs
* Fixed #37: Suggestion add prig files as Copy If Newer to output directory
* Fixed #33: Make framework assemblies private.
* Implemented Experimentally #31: Issue with out parameters
* Merge Infrastructure Enhancement(See also Swathe issues [#1](https://github.com/urasandesu/Swathe/issues/1))
* Fixed #36: If an assembly is added-removed multiple times there is duplicated prebuild steps
* Fixed #35: Rebuilding after .prig file had types removed still contains removed types in prig assembly
* Fix error when enabling Test Adapter and no vstest running
* Fix more generation issues
* Response to Strange Behavior. Depending on the replacing method, the static method of the infrastructure is sometimes called before initializing the field of the type. For example, you will find the behavior if you try [a sample of Generics](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/wiki/Generics) with [Prig v2.0.0-alpha03](https://github.com/urasandesu/Prig/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha03) in Visual Studio integrated environment. It seems very strange behavior, but we have to consider that in this layer.


Version 2.0.0-alpha03
* Improve stability a little. Support the test runners that have never been able to run. The test runners like NUnit(GUI)/xUnit.net/MbUnit couldn't even start up until now(They were raising `ExecutionEngineException`).
